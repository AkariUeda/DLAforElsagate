# Weights and Setup

All weights and setup files needed for each experiment can be found in `weights`.

Directories whose name has `"finetuning"` in it have weights trained/generated by us. The other weights were provided by other authors that kindly made them public.

## GoogLeNet

* `googlenet/transfer_porn`: weights trained for pornography in natural videos -- provided by Perez et al.

* `googlenet/transfer_imagenet`: weights trained for imagenet -- provided by Szegedy et al.  from the [bvlc googlenet repository](http://dl.caffe.berkeleyvision.org/bvlc_googlenet.caffemodel)

<!-- * `googlenet/googlenet_porn_finetuning`: weights trained by us for elsagate, initialized with the model trained for pornography in natural videos provided by Perez et al.

* `googlenet/googlenet_imagenet_finetuning`: weights trained by us for elsagate, initialized with the model trained for imagenet provided by Szegedy et al.  Downloaded from [bvlc googlenet repository](http://dl.caffe.berkeleyvision.org/bvlc_googlenet.caffemodel) -->

## SqueezeNet

* `squeezenet/transfer_imagenet`: weights and setup files provided by Iandola et al. from DeepScale, available at the [author's github](https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet).

* `squeezenet/finetuning`: weights and setup files of the model finetuned from Imagenet's model for the purposes of our project.

## MobileNetV2

* `mobilenetv2`: Since we are using [Keras' implementation of MobileNetV2](https://keras.io/applications/#mobilenetv2), that contains the imagenet model on it, we are only providing the finetuned models and the scripts used to train the models.


## NASNet

* `NASNet`: Since we are using [Keras' implementation of NASNet](https://keras.io/applications/#nasnet), that contains the imagenet model on it, we are only providing the finetuned models and the scripts used to train the models.
